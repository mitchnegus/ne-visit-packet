\grouptitle{BioActinide Chemistry}

\begin{minipage}{0.7\textwidth}
	The multidisciplinary research undergone in the group is at the interface of coordination chemistry, analytical chemistry, photophysics, biological chemistry, health physics, pharmacology, and molecular and cellular biology. 
	We study the effects of heavy element exposure and contamination on different biological systems in addition to the coordination chemistry and metabolic properties of lanthanide and actinide complexes formed with synthetic and biological ligands. 
	Our goals are to gain a better understanding of the biological coordination chemistry and toxicity mechanisms of the f-elements and to develop specific strategies for decontamination, remediation, and separation. 
	Other applications include the development of new antimicrobial strategies that target metal acquisition systems, PET imaging systems, and the design of advanced alpha-immuno therapeutic and diagnostic agents. 
	A new addition to the Nuclear Engineering department as of January 2018, the BioActinide Chemistry group is housed partially on campus and partially at LBNL, where we work closely with the Nuclear Sciences Division. 
	As of February 2019, the group includes 4 graduate students, 7 postdocs, 9 undergraduates,1 staff scientist, and a partridge in a pear tree.

\grouptitle{Applied Nuclear Physics and Radiation Detection}

Our radiation detection and measurement research group at UC-Berkeley comprises two main groups: the BeARING (Berkeley applied Research for the Imaging of Neutrons and Gamma-rays) on campus, and the Applied Nuclear Physics (ANP) group at Lawrence Berkeley National Lab (LBL). 
Additionally, several members of the BeARING group are involved in graduate research at other facilities, including Lawrence Livermore National Lab (LLNL) and Sandia National Lab. 
The research undertaken by members of the group span nearly the entire spectrum of radiation detection and measurement (pun intended). 
On the technology side, the semiconductor fabrication laboratory is involved in projects for the development of novel semiconductor detectors and detector readout methods. 
The high-energy and spatial resolution of these novel systems are tightly coupled to gamma-ray imaging applications in astrophysics, biomedical imaging, and nuclear safeguards/nonproliferation.

In an effort to demonstrate the breadth of research undertaken by the BeARING group, several active projects are detailed below.

\textbf{Algorithm development}\\
Developing innovative algorithms and frameworks to enable more robust radiation detection capabilities, such as modeling variable gamma-ray backgrounds, deploying spectroscopic detection algorithms, and attempting real-time, 3-D gamma-ray image reconstruction.

\textbf{Contextual Sensor and Radiation Data Fusion}\\
Fusing contextual and radiation data enables the visualization of radioactive sources and contamination. 
This capability has been applied to a variety of platforms (drones, cars, SUVs, helicopters) for applications including environmental mapping and decommissioning in Fukushima Prefecture.
 
\textbf{Data management}\\
Developing web-based platforms for data exploration, retrieval, on/offline analysis, and sharing between DOE labs and contractors.
Examples include the Berkeley Data Cloud, which disseminates data for initiatives like the Multiple Informatics for Nuclear Operations Scenarios (MINOS) Venture. 

\textbf{Detector development (Semiconductor Detector Laboratory)}\\
Pushing the limits of ultra-low noise and high-rate Germanium detectors, enabling next generation gamma-ray detection for nuclear structure physics, neutrino and dark matter science, and astrophysics. 
 
\textbf{Sensor networks}\\
Creating large-scale, ubiquitous, and distributed radiation detection sensor networks to passively detect, localize, and track radiological and/or nuclear threats.

\grouptitle{Nuclear Waste Management}

Our group develops methods and models to study various aspects of nuclear fuel cycles and waste management. 
We use these tools to evaluate environmental impacts, management strategies, economics, and proliferation resistance of nuclear fuel cycles. 
At the moment, we have two ongoing projects:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item \textbf{Evaluation and design of nuclear waste containers for Fukushima fuel debris.}
	Management and disposal of the fuel debris created in the meltdowns at the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant present unique challenges due to the random size and shape of the fuel particles and the relatively high enrichment of the heavy metal.
	We develop neutronics models to study the dose rates emitted from different types of waste canisters and evaluate margins protecting against recriticality of the fuel debris.
	\item \textbf{Methodologies for the evaluation of waste management strategies and applications to advanced nuclear fuel cycles.}
	Most fuel cycle analyses utilize insufficient metrics, such as waste mass and radiotoxicity, to quantify benefits in waste management. 
	These quantities are intrinsic properties of the waste streams but do not reflect management or disposal performance. 
	To that end, we develop more representative models that can be used to compare fuel cycles based on the management of their wastes. 
	Examples of these models include long-lived fission product inventory, repository footprint, and criticality safety.

{\huge Reactor Design and Neutronics}

The thrust of our research efforts into advanced reactor fuel cycles is the conception, design and analysis of advanced (Generation-IV+) nuclear reactors and nuclear fuel cycles. 
Specifically, the group has researched four innovative nuclear energy systems.
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Liquid-Salt cooled Advanced High Temperature Reactors (LS-AHTR also referred to as FHR for Fluoride cooled High temperature Reactors);
	\item Breed-and-Burn (B\&B) liquid metal cooled fast reactors,
	\item Fuel-self-sustaining thorium-fueled Boiling Water Reactors (BWR) and
	\item Molten-salt breeder and converter reactors (MSBR).
\end{enumerate}
In researching these systems, the role of the neutronics group is to develop both accurate and efficient core simulation software.
These tools can then be used to search for optimal core, reflector and control system designs. 
To validate results, the neutronics group frequently collaborates with others in the department (for example the thermal hydraulics group, the leader in FHR research) and internationally.

\grouptitle{Computation in Nuclear Engineering}

Our group researches a variety of computational methods designed advance nuclear engineering projects. 
For many group members, this research focuses devleoping of new methods and enhanced algorithms for solving the Boltzmann neutron transport equation. 
The main applications of this work are in reactor design, radiation shielding, and nuclear security and nonproliferation. 
These methods are often inspired by the physics of the problem at hand, developments in computer hardware, or both. 
Ongoing work involves deterministic solution methods, Monte Carlo methods, and hybrid methods in which deterministic solutions are used to accelerate Monte Carlo (MC) solutions. 
Current projects include Monte Carlo on advanced architectures such as Graphical Processing Units, angle-informed hybrid methods for MC, beam shaping assembly design for forensics applications, and developing an neutronics framework called BART (the Bay Area Radiation Transport code).

\grouptitle{Nuclear Physics}

\textbf{Isotope Production:}
The isotopes group has performed a number of cross section measurements to assess the viability of several new isotope production pathways, with emphasis on the production of $^{225}$Ac, $^{64}$Cu, $^{47}$Sc, $^{134}$Ce, $^{86}$Y.  
Measurments take place at both the 88'' cyclotron at LBNL and the high-flux neutron generator (HFNG) located in Etcheverry Hall.  
We collaborate with a number of national labs, where the DOE isotopes program supplies many of the medical isotopes for the U.S.  
Our primary goals are to fill in essential nuclear data gaps, mostly focusing on charged particle and fast-neutron induced reactions, as well as to improve the nuclear modeling of these reactions.  
A better understanding of these reactions will enable the next generation of nuclear medicine, in which ``personalized'' treatments are used to treat cancer.

\textbf{Neutron Scattering:}
Inelastic scattering cross sections have been identified as an important source of uncertainty in neutron transport for current nuclear reactors and for the design of Gen IV reactors. 
Our neutron scattering group is working on the the measurement, modeling and validation of these cross sections. 
This work includes the GENESIS experiment, to measure the energy and angle differential inelastic scattering cross sections for $^{56}$Fe and $^{238}$U. 
Both scattered neutrons and de-excitation gammas will be measured, allowing us to determine both the total inelastic cross section and angular distributions of the outgoing neutrons. 
The uncertainties in both the experiments and the modeling of the cascade of de-excitation gammas are also being characterized, to allow for cross sections to be reported accurately. 
Additionally, work is being done on the ATLAS integral measurement dataset to allow it to be used for validation of reaction calculations.

\textbf{Fission Product Yields:}
The Fast Loading User Facility for Fission Yields (FLUFFY) is a new experimental capability being developed at the 88 inch cyclotron at LBNL.
Once completed, it will feature a pneumatic system that will rapidly transport fissionable samples between a high-flux neutron beam line and an HPGe clover array. 
This will allow for the measurement of independent and cumulative fission yields for products with half-lives down to one second. 
The initial design of FLUFFY is set to be commissioned during an experiment in April 2019. 
Initial measurements using FLUFFY seek to improve fission yield measurements on several short-lived products relevant to the reactor antineutrino anomaly including: $^{92}$Rb, $^{96}$Y, and $^{142}$Cs.

\grouptitle{Dark Matter and Accelerators}

Our group bridges fundamental and applied experimental nuclear physics, utilizing innovative accelerator, ion source, and RF cavity technologies.

One of our primary projects is the Haloscope At Yale Sensitive To Axion Cold dark matter (HAYSTAC). It is a multi-university collaboration searching for axions, a cold dark matter candidate. 
The collaboration consists of UC Berkeley, Yale, and the University of Colorado. 
Housed at Yale, HAYSTAC relies on advanced amplifier, magnet, and cavity technology to achieve extremely low-noise conditions. 
Cooled to hundreds of milliKelvin, the experiment currently operates near the Standard Quantum Limit for noise. 
UC Berkeleyâ€™s contribution to the experiment is the microwave cavity. 
The group here focuses on developing high quality factor/high frequency cavities using novel methods like superconducting thin films and Photonic Band Gap structures.

\grouptitle{Bay Area Neutron Group (BANG)}

The core elements of nuclear physics can be applied to engineer solutions for todayâ€™s most pressing nuclear security problems. 
The Bay Area Neutron Group (BANG) combines basic science, algorithm development, radiation detection, and scientific computing to support global nuclear security and nonproliferation. 
BANG brings an end-to-end approach to this area, with research activities spanning basic nuclear physics to the development of advanced detection technologies. 
Current research activities include organic scintillator characterization for fast neutron detection, neutron-induced inelastic scattering reaction cross sections (GENESIS project), neutron spectroscopy using pulse integral spectrum unfolding, and design of compact high-efficiency neutron imagers. 
The group performs experimental physics at aâ€  number of facilities, most notably at the 88-Inch Cyclotron at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory.
