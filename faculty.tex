% INPUT FILE FOR NUCLEAR ENGINEERING FACULTY
% ------------------------------------------------------------ 
% Each faculty member gets a faculty tile. (Formatting for this tile is defined in the preamble.)
% Each faculty tile is then included in a row of two tiles. (Its formatting also defined in the preamble.)
% The sytax is as follows:
% \facultyrow{
%		\facultytile{image_name_faculty1}
%		{Name faculty 1}
%		{Position faculty 1}
%		{Email faculty 1}
%		{Description faculty1}
