\section*{Graduate Life in Berkeley}
The grad students in our department like to enjoy the variety of things to do in the area such as skiing in Tahoe, hiking in the Berkeley hills, seeing shows in San Francisco and Oakland, hitting up local farmer's markets, and more.
We have a designated social e-mail list and a very active graduate-students-only Slack. There’s always something going on!
